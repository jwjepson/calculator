## Project Description: 
- The goal of this project was to create a fully functional on-screen calculator, as apart of the Odin Project curriculum. This project was meant to combine everything that I've learned about the Front-End thus far, with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## What I've learned:
- Using addEventListener to perform some function, when a specific button was clicked.
- Editing and changing the textContent of a specific HTML element.
- Properly storing variables needed to make function work as expected.
- Disabling buttons when appropriate.
- Checking for corner cases.
- Thoroughly testing to find and fix bugs.
- Using querySelector and querySelectorAll. 
- Continued practice with arrow functions.
- Using forEach to iterate over each element when using querySelectorAll.


## Final Thoughts:
On the surface, this project seemed very simple to create, and in many cases it was. Creating the HTML and CSS for this project was rather simple, but fun because I had the creative control to design the calculator however I wanted. The hardest part of this project was figuring out the correct logic to use to make the calculator work as expected. In addition, figuring out all the corner cases and making sure there were no bugs was sometimes challenging, but I loved the challenge it brought. Overall, I really enjoyed this project and I'm satisified with the result. Feel free to try it out!
